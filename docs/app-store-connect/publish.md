### Optional arguments for action `publish`

##### `--path=APPLICATION_PACKAGE_PATH_PATTERNS`


Path to artifact (\*.ipa or \*.pkg). Can be either a path literal, or a glob pattern to match projects in working directory. Multiple arguments. Default:&nbsp;`**/*.ipa, **/*.pkg`
##### `--apple-id, -u=APPLE_ID`


App Store Connect username used for application package validation and upload if App Store Connect API key is not specified
##### `--password, -p=APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`


App-specific password used for application package validation and upload if App Store Connect API Key is not specified. Used together with `--apple-id` and should match pattern `abcd-abcd-abcd-abcd`. Create an app-specific password in the Security section of your Apple ID account. Learn more from https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397. If not given, the value will be checked from the environment variable `APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`. Alternatively to entering `APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` in plaintext, it may also be specified using the `@env:` prefix followed by an environment variable name, or the `@file:` prefix followed by a path to the file containing the value. Example: `@env:<variable>` uses the value in the environment variable named `<variable>`, and `@file:<file_path>` uses the value from the file at `<file_path>`.
##### `--enable-package-validation, -ev`

If the processing is not finished within the specified timeframe, further submission will be terminated. Waiting will be skipped if the value is set to 0, further actions might fail if the build is not processed yet. If not given, the value will be checked from the environment variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_MAX_BUILD_PROCESSING_WAIT`. [Default: 20]
