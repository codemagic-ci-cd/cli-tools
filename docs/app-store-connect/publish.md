### Optional arguments for action `publish`

##### `--path=APPLICATION_PACKAGE_PATH_PATTERNS`


Path to artifact (\*.ipa or \*.pkg). Can be either a path literal, or a glob pattern to match projects in working directory. Multiple arguments. Default:&nbsp;`**/*.ipa, **/*.pkg`
##### `--apple-id, -u=APPLE_ID`


App Store Connect username used for application package validation and upload if App Store Connect API key is not specified
##### `--password, -p=APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`
