### Optional arguments for command `app-store-connect`

##### `--log-api-calls`


Turn on logging for App Store Connect API HTTP requests
##### `--api-unauthorized-retries, -r=UNAUTHORIZED_REQUEST_RETRIES`


Specify how many times should the App Store Connect API request be retried in case the called request fails due to an authentication error (401 Unauthorized response from the server). In case unauthorized response is returned, then the new request is attempted with a new JSON Web Token until number of attempts is exhausted. If not given, the value will be checked from the environment variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_UNAUTHORIZED_RETRIES`. [Default: 1]
##### `--json`


Whether to show the resource in JSON format
##### `--issuer-id=ISSUER_ID`


App Store Connect API Key Issuer ID. Identifies the issuer who created the authentication token. Learn more at https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating_api_keys_for_app_store_connect_api. If not given, the value will be checked from the environment variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`. Alternatively to entering `ISSUER_ID` in plaintext, it may also be specified using the `@env:` prefix followed by an environment variable name, or the `@file:` prefix followed by a path to the file containing the value. Example: `@env:<variable>` uses the value in the environment variable named `<variable>`, and `@file:<file_path>` uses the value from the file at `<file_path>`.
##### `--key-id=KEY_IDENTIFIER`

If not given, the value will be checked from the environment variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_IDENTIFIER`. Alternatively to entering `KEY_IDENTIFIER` in plaintext, it may also be specified using the `@env:` prefix followed by an environment variable name, or the `@file:` prefix followed by a path to the file containing the value.

If not provided, the key will be searched from the following directories in sequence for a private key file with the name `AuthKey_<key_identifier>.p8`: private_keys, ~/private_keys, ~/.private_keys, ~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys, where <key_identifier> is the value of --key-id. If not given, the value will be checked from the environment variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY`. Alternatively to entering `PRIVATE_KEY` in plaintext, it may also be specified using the `@env:` prefix followed by an environment variable name, or the `@file:` prefix followed by a path to the file containing the value.
