##### `--earliest-release-date=EARLIEST_RELEASE_DATE`


Specify earliest return date for scheduled release type (see `--release-type` configuration option). Timezone aware ISO8601 timestamp with hour precision, for example `2021-11-10T14:00:00+00:00`.
##### `--release-type=MANUAL | AFTER_APPROVAL | SCHEDULED`
