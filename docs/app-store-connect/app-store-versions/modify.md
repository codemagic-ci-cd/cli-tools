##### `--api-unauthorized-retries, -r=UNAUTHORIZED_REQUEST_RETRIES`


Specify how many times the App Store Connect API request should be retried in case the called request fails due to an authentication error (401 Unauthorized response from the server). In case of the above authentication error, the request is retried usinga new JSON Web Token as many times until the number of retries is exhausted.

If not given, the value will be checked from the environment variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`. Alternatively to entering `ISSUER_ID` in plaintext, it may also be specified using the `@env:` prefix followed by an environment variable name, or the `@file:` prefix followed by a path to the file containing the value. Example: `@env:<variable>` uses the value in the environment variable named `<variable>`, and `@file:<file_path>` uses the value from the file at `<file_path>`.
##### `--key-id=KEY_IDENTIFIER`


App Store Connect API Key ID. Learn more at https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating_api_keys_for_app_store_connect_api. If not given, the value will be checked from the environment variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_IDENTIFIER`. Alternatively to entering `KEY_IDENTIFIER` in plaintext, it may also be specified using the `@env:` prefix followed by an environment variable name, or the `@file:` prefix followed by a path to the file containing the value.
