### Required arguments for action `submit-to-app-store`

##### `BUILD_ID_RESOURCE_ID`


Alphanumeric ID value of the Build
### Optional arguments for action `submit-to-app-store`

##### `--max-build-processing-wait, -w=MAX_BUILD_PROCESSING_WAIT`


Maximum amount of minutes to wait for the freshly uploaded build to be processed by Apple and retry submitting the build for (beta) review. Works in conjunction with TestFlight beta review submission, or App Store review submission and operations that depend on either one of those. If the processing is not finished within the specified timeframe, further submission will be terminated. Waiting will be skipped if the value is set to 0, further actions might fail if the build is not processed yet. If not given, the value will be checked from the environment variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_MAX_BUILD_PROCESSING_WAIT`. [Default: 20]
##### `--cancel-previous-submissions`


Cancels previous App Store submissions for the application in App Store Connect before creating a new submission if the submissions are in a state where it is possible. This option is not available for TestFlight submissions.
##### `--app-store-version-info, -vi=APP_STORE_VERSION_INFO`


General App information and version release options for App Store version submission as a JSON encoded object. Alternative to individually defining `--platform`, `--copyright`, `--earliest-release-date`, `--release-type` and `--version-string`. For example, `{"platform": "IOS", "copyright": "2008 Acme Inc.", "version_string": "1.0.8", "release_type": "SCHEDULED", "earliest_release_date": "2021-11-10T14:00:00+00:00"}`. Definitions from the JSON will be overridden by dedicated CLI options if provided. If not given, the value will be checked from the environment variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_APP_STORE_VERSION_INFO`. Alternatively to entering `APP_STORE_VERSION_INFO` in plaintext, it may also be specified using the `@env:` prefix followed by an environment variable name, or the `@file:` prefix followed by a path to the file containing the value. Example: `@env:<variable>` uses the value in the environment variable named `<variable>`, and `@file:<file_path>` uses the value from the file at `<file_path>`.
##### `--copyright=COPYRIGHT`


The name of the person or entity that owns the exclusive rights to your app, preceded by the year the rights were obtained (for example, `2008 Acme Inc.`). Do not provide a URL.
##### `--earliest-release-date=EARLIEST_RELEASE_DATE`

Example: `@env:<variable>` uses the value in the environment variable named `<variable>`, and `@file:<file_path>` uses the value from the file at `<file_path>`.
##### `--app-store-version-localizations, -vl=APP_STORE_VERSION_LOCALIZATION_INFOS`
