Version 0.34.0
-------------

This release includes changes from [PR #269](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/269).

**Bugfix**:
- Previously non-encrypted private keys and PKCS#12 containers were treated equivalently to those that were encrypted with empty string. Now empty password for non-encrypted secret will yield an error, and vice-versa, not providing password for secret that is encrypted with empty string will also fail with encryption error.

**Dependencies**:
- Remove direct [`pyOpenSSL`](https://www.pyopenssl.org/) dependency.

**Development**:
- Replace `OpenSSL.crypto` usages with alternatives from `cryptography` library.
- Deprecate initialization of `codemagic.models.Certificate` from `OpenSSL.crypto.X509` instances. For now this will issue a warning, but will be fully removed in future versions.

Version 0.29.0
-------------

This release includes changes from [PR #244](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/244). The goal of this release is to migrate to [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) compliant build system by using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) dependency management and packaging tool.

**Development**
- Migrate project dependency management from [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/) to [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
- Add `pyproject.toml` project file to specify dependencies, project packaging information and code style requirements. Flake8 configuration remains in `.flake8` as it does not support `pyproject.toml` yet.
- Changes to GitHub actions:
  - Update caching configuration.
  - Replace `pipenv` usages in GitHub action with Poetry.
- Changes to Codemagic workflows:
  - In `release` workflow run CI checks before building wheels and distribution. Use Poetry for building and PyPI releases.
  - Use Poetry in `test` workflow instead of Pipenv.
  - Define `release-test` workflow to build and release binary to [PyPI test mirror](https://test.pypi.org/).
- Project files `setup.cfg`, `setup.py`, `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` were removed.
- Add `.pre-commit-config.yaml` which defines [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks.
- Move Ruby script `bin/code_signing_manager.rb` to `src/codemagic/scripts/code_signing_manager.rb`. This script will not be added to system `$PATH` at the time of package installation anymore. Consequence of this is that the action `xcode-project use-profiles` will now use the script which is bundled with installation, instead of what is available globally in the system.

**Docs**
- Update `README.md`:
  - update example code snippets that are out of date,
  - include all installed CLI tools to installed tools list,
  - add instructions for setting up development environment.

Version 0.28.0
-------------

This release includes changes and fixes from [PR #243](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/243).

**Bugfixes**
- Fix properties `not_after` and `not_before` of `codemagic.models.Certificate` to work with `pyOpenSSL` versions `<=19.1.0`.

**Development**
- Remove type stubs for package `cryptography`.
- Add tuple `SUPPORTED_PUBLIC_KEY_TYPES` to module `codemagic.models.private_key`.
- Remove [`OpenSSL.crypto.X509`](https://www.pyopenssl.org/en/stable/api/crypto.html?highlight=X509#x509-objects) usages from `codemagic.models.Certificate` internals by replacing them with functionality from [`cryptography.x509.Certificate`](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/x509/reference/#x-509-certificate-object).

Version 0.27.6
-------------

**Features**:
- Action `xcode-project run-tests` will now respect retried testcase outcome. In case the initial testcase execution fails, but retrying is turned on (by `-retry-tests-on-failure` Xcode testing flag) and subsequent testcase run turns out to be successful, then this testcase will not be considered as _failed_ in the context of whole test suite. [PR #242](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/242)

Version 0.27.5
-------------

**Dependencies**:
- Remove upper bound version limit `<37` from [`cryptography`](https://cryptography.io/) dependency, but exclude version [`37.0.0`](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/changelog/#v37-0-1) as it conflicts with `pyOpenSSL`. [PR #241](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/241)
- Remove upper bound version limit from [`google-api-python-client`](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client) as all used functionality works also with recent versions. [PR #241](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/241)

Version 0.27.4

[PR #214](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/214)

Version 0.23.0
-------------

This release includes changes from [PR #213](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/213) to improve command line usage and Python client usability for managing Android keystores.

**Breaking**
- Remove key password option (specified by `-l`, `--ks-key-pass` or `--key-pass`) from action `android-keystore verify` as it is not used.

**Features**
- Add new action `android-keystore certificates` to list information about certificates included in the keystore.

**Development**
- **Breaking.** Remove `key_password` keyword argument from `AndroidKeystore.verify`.
- **Breaking.** Change signature of `Keytool.validate_keystore`. Instead of taking `keystore: Keystore` as the argument, now `keystore_path: pathlib.Path`, `keystore_password: str` and, `key_alias: str` are taken. Method functionality remains intact.
- Add new method `Keytool.get_certificates -> List[Certificate]` to extract certificates from specified android keystore.
- Add new convenience methods to `codemagic.models.Certificate`:
  - `get_summary() -> Dict` to generate JSON serializable dictionary containing information about the certificate.
  - `get_text_summary() -> str` that generates a printable and user-readable string representation of the certificate's information.

**Docs**
- Update documentation for tool `android-keystore`.
- Update documentation for action `android-keystore verify`.
- Add documentation for action `android-keystore certificates`.

Version 0.22.5
-------------

**Fixes**
- Return `True` from `Certificate.is_development_certificate` property if the certificate is _Mac Development_ code signing certificates, as those certificates are used to sign development versions of Mac apps. [PR #212](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/212)

Version 0.22.4
-------------

**Development**
- Add properties `creation_date` and `expiration_date` to `ProvisioningProfile` object. [PR #211](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/211)

Version 0.22.3
-------------

This is a bugfix release from [PR #210](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/210) to fix problems with tool `android-keystore` that was first added in [version 0.21.0](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/releases/tag/v0.21.0).

**Improvements**
- Use better error message for keystore validation in case non-keystore file is passed for validation.

**Fixes**
- Fix debug keystore creation using action `android-keystore create-debug-keysotre`. It was using invalid keyword argument to specify keystore path.
- Make keystore path argument `--keystore` required for `android-keystore create` and `android-keystore verify` actions.

Version 0.22.2
-------------

This is a bugfix release from [PR #209](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/209).

**Fixes**
- Fix loading code signing entitlements from Xcode archives and iOS App Store Packages (`*.xcarchive` and `*.ipa` files respectively) with Xcode 13.3+. A tool called `codesign` which is bundled with Xcode is used to extract code signing entitlements information from application packages. The version of `codesign` included in Xcode 13.3 came with some modifications that broke the flow which is used to collect code signing entitlements.

Version 0.22.1
-------------

**Development**
- [PEP 561](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/) compliance. Include `py.typed` marker file to indicate that this package has inline type hints. [PR #207](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/207)

Version 0.21.0
-------------

This release contains updates from [PR #206](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/206).

**Features**
- Add new tool `android-keystore` to Android app code signing keystores. New actions are:
  - `android-keystore create` to initialize new Android keystore,
  - `android-keystore create-debug-keystore` to initialize new debug Android keystore with default settings,
  - `android-keystore verify` to check that Android keystore alias and passwords are correct.

**Development**
- Add optional `env` keyword argument to `CliProcess.execute` method to specify process specific environment variables.
- Add dataclass `CertificateAttributes` to store certificate issuer information.
- Add dataclass `Keystore` to store keystore information.
- Add new module `codemagic.shell_tools` to contain Python wrappers for command line utilities.
- Add minimal Python wrapper for `keytool` command line utility in `codemagic.shell_tools.Keytool`.


**Docs**
- Add documentation for tool `android-keystore`.
- Add documentation for action `android-keystore create`.
- Add documentation for action `android-keystore create-debug-keystore`.
- Add documentation for action `android-keystore verify`.

Version 0.20.0
-------------

This release contains improvements from [PR #205](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/205).

**Features**
- Add option `--p12-path` for `app-store-connect` actions `create-certificate` and `get-certificate` to specify PKCS#12 container save path that can be used together with `--save` to specify exact file path where the container is saved. It overrides default save location, which is configured by `--certificates-dir`.

**Fixes**
- Support certificates that do not have common name defined in subject.

**Development**
- Describe new common argument type `CommonArgumentType.non_existing_path` which asserts that specified file does not exist.
- PKCS#12 support in `pyOpenSSL` is deprecated and `cryptography` APIs should be used instead. Replace the deprecated `crypto.load_pkcs12` in `Certificate.from_p12` with `cryptography`'s `pkcs12.load_key_and_certificates`.
- Add new factory method `PricateKey.from_p12` to load private key from PKCS#12 container.
- Allow using `PrivateKey` instances for `AppStoreConnect` methods that take `certificate_key` argument. Before only instances of `Types.CertificateKeyArgument` were supported.
- Support `DSA` and elliptic curve private keys for `PrivateKey`.

Version 0.19.1
-------------

This is a bugfix release from [PR #204](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/204) to address the regression introduced in [PR #203](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/203).

**Fixes**
- Fix export options plist generation with `xcode-project use-profiles` in case provisioning profiles with wildcard identifiers (such as `*` or `com.example.*`) were used.

**Development**
- Add new data container class `ProvisioningProfileAssignment` which can be used to track the Xcode project target onto which certain provisioning profile was assigned to.
- Change `ExportOptions` factory method `from_used_profiles(cls, used_profiles: Sequence[ProvisioningProfile]) -> ExportOptions` to `from_profile_assignments(cls, profile_assignments: Sequence[ProvisioningProfileAssignment])`. This will persist the actual bundle identifiers of the Xcode targets when the property list constructed, instead of possibly using wildcard identifiers from provisioning profiles.

Version 0.19.0
-------------

This release includes changes from [PR #203](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/203) to improve usability and feedback from `xcode-project use-profiles`.

**Features**
- Improve `xcode-project use-profiles` log output. Highlight Xcode targets for which code signing settings were not configured, but are likely necessary for successful build.
- Add `--code-signing-setup-verbose-logging` option to action `xcode-project use-profiles` which turns on detailed log output for code signing settings configuration.

**Docs**
- Update docs for `xcode-project use-profiles` action. Add documentation for option `--code-signing-setup-verbose-logging`.

**Development**
- **Breaking.** Remove dataclass `codemagic.models.matched_profiles.MatchedProfile` and all its usages.
- **Breaking.** Replace `ExportOptions.from_matched_profiles` with `ExportOptions.from_used_profiles`. Old method was relying on the removed `MatchedProfile` class, while new method has more generic interface requiring only sequence of `ProvisioningProfiles` as arguments.
- **Breaking.** Change command line interface for `code_signing_manager.rb`:
  - Replace command line option `-u` / `--used-profiles` with `-r` / `--result-path` to better reflect the updated contents of result file.
  - Results saved into file specified by `--result-path` will now include all found Xcode targets, including those that were not assigned provisioning profile. The targets for which matching provisioning profile was found and configured, the reference also includes the used provisioning profile `uuid`.
  - The saved JSON file structure what used to be `{profile_uuid: [<target_info>, ...]}` is now `[<target_info>, ...]`.
- Always multiplex `code_signing_manager.rb` verbose log output to main file log.
- `CodeSigningManager.use_profiles` logs Xcode project targets for which provisioning profiles were not found, but are likely necessary for building `ipa`.

Version 0.18.1
-------------

**Fixes**
- Allow using `manageAppVersionAndBuildNumber` as an export option when building with `xcode-project build-ipa`. [PR #201](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/201)

Version 0.18.0
-------------

**Fixes**
- When creating new provisioning profiles as part of action `app-store-connect fetch-signing-files` include only eligible devices when creating the profiles. Before the action could fail for example in case when iOS development or Ad Hoc provisioning profile was created, but an Apple TV device was included as a create parameter. [PR #200](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/200)

**Features**
- Change default behaviour for resolving certificate type from provisioning profile type. Map `IOS_APP_ADHOC` provisioning profile type to `DISTRIBUTION` certificate type instead of `IOS_DISTRIBUTION`. "Apple Distribution" certificates can be used to sign any type of application (iOS, tvOS, Mac, Universal, etc.) and as a result fewer certificates are required. Applies to the following actions:
  - `app-store-connect fetch-signing-files`,
  - `app-store-connect list-certificates`.

  This change is backwards compatible in the sense that existing matching `IOS_DISTRIBUTION` certificates are still used for `IOS_APP_ADHOC` provisioning profiles if found. [PR #198](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/198)

**Development**
- Behaviour of `CertificateType.from_profile_type` was changed:
  - calling it with `ProfileType.IOS_APP_STORE` returns `CertificateType.DISTRIBUTION` instead of `CertificateType.IOS_DISTRIBUTION` as before. [PR #198](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/198)

Version 0.17.2
-------------

This is a bugfix release to fix the regression introduced in v0.17.1.

**Fixes**
- Consider OpenSSH private keys for `app-store-connect` argument `--certificate-key` valid again. Due to changes in [PR #196](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/196) only PEM encoded keys were accepted as certificate keys, but OpenSSH keys are not fully compatible with the PEM standard, and should be allowed too. [PR #197](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/197)

Version 0.17.1
-------------

**Fixes**
- Validate that App Store Connect API private key specified for `app-store-connect` tool by argument `--private-key` is a valid PEM encoded key. [PR #196](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/196)

Version 0.17.0
-------------

**Features**
- When retrying `altool` commands as part of `app-store-connect publish` action, kill open Xcode processes before another attempt is made. It is applicable only if the action is launched in CI environment (environment variable `CI` is set to _truthy_ value). [PR #192](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/192)

**Fixes**
- Value of test output directory, specified by argument `--output-dir`, for actions [`xcode-project junit-test-results`](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/v0.16.1/docs/xcode-project/junit-test-results.md#junit-test-results) and [`xcode-project run-tests`](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/v0.16.1/docs/xcode-project/run-tests.md#run-tests) had to point to existing directory, which is too restrictive. Change it so that the specified test output directory can be either created, or it has to exist. File paths are still considered to be invalid inputs. [PR #191](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/191)
- Fix default test destination for `xcode-project run-tests` when tests are run for macOS SDK. Omit test destination for these cases as the tests will be launched on the host machine directly. Otherwise, the default simulator obtained by [`xcode-project default-test-destination`](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/v0.16.1/docs/xcode-project/default-test-destination.md) is still used as before if no devices are specified. [PR #191](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/191)

**Docs**
- Apply bold style to Markdown docs that are shown using ANSI bold in terminal help messages. [PR #190](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/190)
- Apply pre style to Markdown docs that are shown in bright blue color in terminal help messages. [PR #190](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/190)
- Update docs for `xcode-project run-tests` action. [PR #191](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/191)

**Development**
- Add function `codemagic.cli.environment.is_ci_environment() -> bool` which checks whether current process is being run in a CI environment. Check is being performed based on the value of `CI` environment variable. [PR #192](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/192)

**Dependencies**
- Add [`psutil`](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/) Python dependency (version `5.8.0+`) to manage ongoing system processes in a platform-agnostic way. [PR #192](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/192)
- Bumps `pipenv` dependency from version `2021.11.23` to `2022.1.8` (development only). [PR #193](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/193)

Version 0.16.1
-------------

**Fixes**
- Revoke cached App Store Connect API JSON web token when unauthorized request retry attempts are exhausted. [PR #188](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/188)

**Development**
- Log for which App Store Connect API key JWT is generated or loaded from disk cache. [PR #188](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/188)
- Remove `reset_token` parameter from `AppStoreConnectApiClient.generate_auth_headers`. [PR #188](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/188)
- Add optional `revoke_auth_info: Callable[[], None]` parameter to `AppStoreConnectApiSession` to reset App Store Connect API authentication information in case of unauthorized requests. [PR #188](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/188)

Version 0.16.0
-------------

**Features**
- Change default behaviour for resolving certificate type from provisioning profile type. Map both `IOS_APP_STORE` and `MAC_APP_STORE` provisioning profile types to `DISTRIBUTION` certificate type instead of the old approach where `IOS_DISTRIBUTION` and `MAC_APP_DISTRIBUTION` certificate types were used respectively. "Apple Distribution" certificates can be used to sign any type of application (iOS, tvOS, Mac, Universal, etc.) and as a result fewer certificates are required. Applies to the following actions:
  - `app-store-connect fetch-signing-files`,
  - `app-store-connect list-certificates`.

  This change is backwards compatible in the sense that existing matching `IOS_DISTRIBUTION` and `MAC_APP_DISTRIBUTION` certificates are still used for `IOS_APP_STORE` and `MAC_APP_STORE` provisioning profiles if found. [PR #185](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/185)
- Unify formatting for signing certificates, profiles and bundle IDs in `app-store-connect fetch-signing-files` log output. [PR #185](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/185)
- Multiple `--type` arguments are now supported for `app-store-connect list-certificates` action. [PR #185](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/185)
- When either signing certificate or provisioning profile is saved to disk (for example as part of `app-store-connect fetch-signing-files`), then the save path will include resource ID and type, which makes it possible to easily match process output to file on disk. [PR #185](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/185)

**Dependencies**
- Update required [PyJWT](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) version from `2.0.0` to `2.3.0`.  [#186](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/186)

**Development**
- Behaviour of `CertificateType.from_profile_type` was changed:
  - calling it with `ProfileType.IOS_APP_STORE` returns `CertificateType.DISTRIBUTION` instead of `CertificateType.IOS_DISTRIBUTION` as before,
  - and calling it with `ProfileType.MAC_APP_STORE` returns `CertificateType.DISTRIBUTION` instead of `CertificateType.MAC_APP_DISTRIBUTION`. [PR #185](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/185)
- Signature of `AppStoreConnect.list_certificates` was updated. Method argument `certificate_type: Optional[CertificateType] = None` was deprecated and replaced by `certificate_types: Optional[Union[CertificateType, Sequence[CertificateType]]] = None`. This change is fully backwards compatible in the sense that as of now both the positional usage of the argument still works, and `certificate_type` can still also be used as a keyword argument. [PR #185](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/185)

**Docs**
- Update documentation for `app-store-connect list-certificates` to reflect the possibility of multiple `--type` arguments. [PR #185](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/185)

Version 0.15.0
-------------

**Features**
- Add `--api-unauthorized-retries` option to `app-store-connect` actions to gracefully handle invalid `401 Unauthorized` responses from App Store Connect API. In case HTTP request to App Store Connect API fails with authentication error, generate new JSON Web Token, and try to do the request again until retries are exhausted. Retry count default to `3` for CLI invocations. [PR #178](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/178)
- Improve error messages for CLI invocations in case invalid value is provided to CLI argument that can be specified using an environment variable. [PR #180](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/180)
- Add option to cache App Store Connect JSON Web Token to disk so that the same token could be reused between subsequent `app-store-connect` command invocations to avoid false positive authentication errors from App Store Connect API. [PR #181](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/181)
- All `app-store-connect` actions have new option `--disable-jwt-cache` to turn off caching App Store Connect JWT to disk. The default behaviour is to have disk cache enabled. That is JWT is loaded from disk if present and not expired, and generated tokens are cached to disk unless this feature is turned off. [PR #181](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/181)

**Development**
- `AppStoreConnect`, `AppStoreConnectApiClient` and `AppStoreConnectApiSession` classes take new optional keyword argument `unauthorized_request_retries` which defines how many times request with unauthorized response should be retried. [PR #178](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/178)
- Use custom abstract metaclass for `TypedCliArgument` that enables class name transformation during CLI argument parsing. Pretty class name can be defined using `type_name_in_argparse_error` attribute on classes that inherit from `TypedCliArgument`. In case pretty name is not defined, then basic types are mapped to string representation, and otherwise `CamelCase` names are converted `camel case`. [PR #180](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/180)
- Extract logic that deals with App Store Connect JWT generation and lifespan from `AppStoreConnectApiClient` to standalone `JsonWebTokenManager` class. [PR #181](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/181)
- `AppStoreConnect` and `AppStoreConnectApiClient` classes take new optional keyword argument `enable_jwt_cache` which configures whether the JSON web token is cached to file or not. [PR #181](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/181)

**Docs**
- Update docs for `app-store-connect` actions and include information about `--api-unauthorized-retries` option. [PR #179](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/179)
- Update docs for `app-store-connect` actions and include information about `--disable-jwt-cache` option. [PR #183](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/183)

Version 0.14.1
-------------

**Fixes**
- In case updating or creating localized App Store version meta information fails for any of the provided languages, do not fail the calling action, but log the error instead. Has an effect on `app-store-connect publish` and `app-store-connect builds submit-to-app-store`. [PR #175](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/175)

Version 0.14.0
-------------

**Deprecations**
- Option `--skip-package-validation` of `app-store-connect publish` is ignored and shows a deprecation warning. [PR #174](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/174)

**Features**
- Change `app-store-connect publish` not to run package validation by default before uploading it to App Store Connect. [PR #174](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/174)
- Add new option `--enable-package-validation` to action `app-store-connect publish` that turns on package validation before it is uploaded to App Store Connect. [PR #174](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/174)

Version 0.13.2
-------------

**Features**
- Improve error messages for CLI invocations in case invalid value was provided for argument with `Enum` type. [PR #170](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/170)

**Fixes**

- Use correct package type for `altool` commands when publishing tvOS apps using `app-store-connect publish`. [PR #173](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/pull/173)

Version 0.13.1
